Parallel Programming README
------------------------------

- This project was made to demonstrate simple parallel programming execution using the Game of Life.

- the main block of execution code has an instance for single-thread and multi-thread.

- The visualization is done using OpenGL and multi-threading by Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB).

Parallel Profiling Data
------------------------------

- If you're interested in how the code performs under various conditions, please check out the Parallel Profiling Data Doc in the repo.
- It has a full breakdown of runtimes between different hardware examples, with a number of different tests for each one.
